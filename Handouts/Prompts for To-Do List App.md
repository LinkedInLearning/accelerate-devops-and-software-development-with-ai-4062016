# Prompts for To-Do List App

---

## First Prompt

> I want to build a Todo list web app. Please help me break this down into user stories, epics, and subtasks with estimated effort (e.g., in story points) and a suggested timeline for sprints. You can see here that I’ve provided the context and the output format I would like.

**Context:**
- It’s a simple web app where users can create, update, and delete tasks
- Core features: User authentication (sign up or login), task CRUD, categories or tags, due dates, and a clean UI
- Tech stack: React (front end), Node.js/Express (back end), and PostgreSQL (database)
- Team size: Three developers
- Sprint length: Two weeks

**Output format I would like:**
- Epics (for example, “Authentication”, “Task Management”, or “UI/UX”)
- User stories under each epic (in user story format, for example, “As a user, I want to…so that…”)
- Subtasks for each story (for example, API endpoint, database migration, or UI component)
- Effort estimates (use story points: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8)
- Suggested sprint plan (assign stories or subtasks to two-week sprints given a team velocity of approximately 25 points per sprint)

**Please present the output in a clear, structured table with columns: Sprint, Epic, User Story, Subtasks, Estimate (SP).**

## Second Prompt

> I’m building a simple to-do app in Python. Please write only the function signatures (no implementations) for the four basic CRUD operations on a task resource.
