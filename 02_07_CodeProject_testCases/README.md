These are the prompts used to design test cases for Chapter 2, Video 7 "Coding Project - Create AI-assisted test cases in Python". Follow the prompts below to practice AI-assisted development and testing workflows.

### Training Prompt 1 - Basic Demo Function

Copy and use this prompt with your AI assistant:

```
Write a demo() function for this BookService that:
Creates two books.
Gets the first book.
Lists all books.
Deletes one book and verifies it's gone.
Use plain assert statements.
```
### Training Prompt 2 - Comprehensive Edge Cases

Copy and use this prompt with your AI assistant:

```
For this pure-Python BookService, list edge cases to test. Include invalid inputs, boundary ids, search quirks, sort stability, duplicate titles/authors, and very large lists.
```

### Training Prompt 3 - Convert to pytest

Next, we’ll convert these to pytest with parametrization. Copy and use this prompt with your AI assistant:

```
Convert these tests to pytest with parametrize for sorting. Keep tests simple and readable.
```
